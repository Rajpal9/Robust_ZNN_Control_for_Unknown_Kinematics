# Robust_ZNN_Control_for_Unknown_Kinematics
This is the Github repository for a neural control architecture that employs input-output information to compensate for the lack of knowledge about the robot model to achieve prescribed tracking performance in the presence of joint constraints described in the paper title "Approximation-Free Robust Tracking Control of Unknown Redundant Manipulators With Prescribed Performance and Input Constraints". The paper can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10649593
